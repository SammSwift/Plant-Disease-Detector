This repo contains all the codes, documents, and links for my KaggleX final project which was on "Enhancing Agriculture through Computer Vision-Based Plant Disease Detection"

## üéØOverview
The goal of this project is to develop an innovative solution that leverages computer vision technology to revolutionize the way farmers detect and manage plant diseases. Our primary objective is to empower farmers with a timely and accurate tool for identifying plant diseases in their crops, thereby facilitating early intervention and minimizing crop loss.

## üõ†Ô∏èTools and Libraries
- Tensorflow
- Python
- Opencv
- Streamlit
- Roboflow
- Ultralytics YOLO V8
- OpenAI ChatGPT API
- Google Colab
